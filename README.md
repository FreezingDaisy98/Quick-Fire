# Quick Fire

A mod that allows you to quickly use the 2-9 hotbar slots.

## How It Works

Once a configurable button **(r)** is pressed, the game moves through each hotbar slot every 2 game ticks and right clicks.

### Configuration

To configure the default button **(r)** go to **options** ---> **controls** ---> **keybinds** then scroll to where you see the **Quick Fire** keybind(s) then click on **(r)** and then press the new keybind of your choice.
